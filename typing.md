# Touch typing

Hi, my name is Roman, and I am addicted to tools.

Do you type for hours every day like I do? Then let me share a year-long
journey to ~~the holy grail~~ ergonomic typing. Touch typing can change
your life (in a good way). If you're looking for a new keyboard or
considering learning an alternative layout, you should definitely keep
reading.

## Long story short

I "touch typed" with seven fingers for decades and managed to type at
average speed with pretty poor accuracy. I tried so many times to learn
proper technique, but I always gave up in a week. A year ago I decided it
was now or never. I had only one goal: to type faster, like 100 WPM.
_Spoiler: I'm not there yet_. Back then I was using QWERTY on an Apple
Wireless keyboard.

This was my method: "Okay, roll up your sleeves, and just memorize every
key for all ten fingers." It took two days. I memorized all the keys
during that weekend. Typing speed plummeted to 10 WPM on the first day; I
was "thinking" before pressing almost every key. I could type with 100%
accuracy without looking, but it was very very slow.

Next phase: typing lessons every day for an hour. From time to time I
typed with my seven (favorite) fingers when I needed to get work done, but
in a few days I switched to the ten-finger method cold turkey. I continued
practicing every day at [Keybr][keybr] and [Keyhero][keyhero] and finally reached
40 WPM in two weeks.

Phew...

As soon as I returned to my original speed and accuracy, I decided to
upgrade my keyboard to an ergonomic one. Two months later [ErgoDox][ez]
arrived. And of course, I wanted to try an alternative keyboard layout on
it. After a quick analysis, I picked the Norman layout: it's easy to
learn, and it significantly reduces distance traveled from the home row.

Relearning. My speed dropped to 10 WPM, and recovered to 40 WPM in three
weeks. I switched to the ErgoDox full time and played with ErgoDox layers,
ending up with a single-layer solution. I reached 50 WPM in 40 days and
stopped all typing lessons.

Today I am a happy ErgoDox user. My average speed on Norman is 60 WPM, and
it's increasing every month, slowly but steadily.

## Lessons learned

Fast and accurate typing is a must-have skill for a programmer. I wish I'd
switched to the right path earlier.

I am not the fastest typist, just a bit quicker than average. My
achievements in terms of words per minute are very humble. Still, I can
say the return on investment is overwhelmingly high.

## Proper typing style

Better typing speed saves me a few hours every week on code documentation,
notes, and emails. Fast typing enables blogging: you can find an hour for
a draft, but it is harder to find two. So a difference of 20 WPM can
affect your productivity quite significantly.

If you are an average typist, you should invest few minutes a day in
typing lessons. Focus on accuracy and practice every day. Totally worth
it.

## Ergonomic keyboard

If you have a Mac, there's a good chance that your keyboard is excellent.
Apple keyboards are robust, compact, and quiet.

ErgoDox is louder and bigger. The primary benefit of ErgoDox is
ergonomics. (Surprise!) As with any split keyboard, you can sit (or stand)
straight, so your posture is healthier, and it's simply more relaxing.

My initial goal was just to improve my typing speed. Of course, high speed
is necessary, but when I started using ErgoDox, I realized that comfort is
the primary reward: my hands, shoulders, and back are much happier now.
Yes, ErgoDox costs three hundred dollars, but it's the best keyboard
available today for that price, and the keyboard is the most important
part of my workplace. If you're typing all day long, you can connect your
awesome keyboard to [a nine-dollar computer][chip] and be productive in no
time.

**Why EZ?** Wrist rest and tilt kit. High quality. Excellent service.
2-year warranty.

I have chosen ErgoDox with Cherry MX Brown switches, blank DCS keycaps, and
my custom single-layer layout.

**Why Cherry MX Brown?** Blue switches are louder than brown; other
switches are not that good for typing. If you are not sure, browns are the
great default choice.

**Why DCS?** I tried DSA for a month, but during that experiment, my
accuracy was lower than with DCS. With sculpted keycaps my fingers "know"
where they are, while it is a bit harder with DSA profile keycaps to find
home row.

**Why a custom single-layer layout?** Layout switching is an extra step I
would like to avoid. Everything I need fits well into one layer (I even
have one key left unused). By default, ErgoDox comes with a multiple-layer
layout. I liked the idea and tried to use layers, but I found out that
layer switching is expensive. You have to press and sometimes hold two or
more keys simultaneously. I encourage every ErgoDox user to try a
single-layer layout first and add extra layers only when you need to
assign more keys and the base layer is full.

**Why blank keycaps?** I don't look at my keyboard anymore, so I don't
need any labels.

## Alternative keyboard layout

I use Norman and like it better than QWERTY. I haven't tried any other
layouts, and honestly, I'm not sure that learning alternative layouts is
worth it. What I am 100% sure of is that I can learn any keyboard layout
and be productive in two weeks. Layouts and keyboards do not limit my
speed; my fingers can move faster than I can compose words in English.

Why not stick with QWERTY on all my keyboards? Switching to a different
layout and keyboard helped me break my bad typing habits. It's easier to
learn correct technique from scratch on an entirely new instrument than it
is to to fix those bad habits deeply wired into your brain.

**How did I choose Norman?** Two sources. First, people who already who
use multiple layouts for years: [Gary Bernhardt][gary], [Aaron
Patterson][aaron], a good review by [Ted][ted]. Second, I compared Dvorak,
Colemak, Workman, Norman, and even my custom layout with [a keyboard
layout analyzer][kla] (made by Patrick Gillespie). Norman performed
slightly better than the others on my custom corpus of text.

One more reason I picked Norman: It's easy to switch to QWERTY and back to
Norman in few minutes. (I use QWERTY when I travel.) Norman is just a
fifteen-key difference from QWERTY.

I use Vim with both QWERTY and Norman, and I do not remap anything in Vim.
In the beginning, I had one annoying issue: `HJKL` on Norman are in weird
locations. I was hitting `U` instead of `J`. That was such a painful week.
Now everything is just fine.

Looking back, I am not entirely sure if all these layouts made any
difference in my case. I can learn any crazy layout and reach an average
speed in few weeks, but it won't increase my speed beyond that level.
Maybe I should try QWERTY on ErgoDox someday.

## Level up

If you need to type at high speed for hours at a time, then you should
probably follow Mirabai Knight and learn [stenography][steno]. Beware: the
learning curve for steno is steep and you need a steno machine (or for the
first time you can use NKRO keyboard, e.g., ErgoDox).

## Conclusion

Typing can be fun if you fix your bad typing habits. The earlier you start
learning, the more rewarding it can be. Teach kids to touch type as soon
as they start playing with the computer. This skill will stay relevant for
at least one more generation.

If you want to take away only one thing from my story, it's this: Learn
proper touch typing technique today.

## Recipe

Take a typing test on [Keyhero][keyhero]. Slower than 40 WPM? Practice 15
minutes every day for a month. If your accuracy is lower than 95%, slow
down and try to type as accurately as possible.

If you type more than four hours every day, you should use an ergonomic
keyboard.
