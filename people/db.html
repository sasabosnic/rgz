<p class="f3 lh-title ni">&#8220;In 2011 my friends and I were
building web application for a few long term projects, and we were
lucky Denis accepted our invitation to join the team as a frontend
developer.</p>

<p>Denis has been a CSS wizard for years and he quickly picked up
JavaScript. With Denis's help we've launched those projects and
kept them growing for few years.</p>

<p>Later Denis joined our frontend team in Singapore, as Senior
Software Engineer at Cinarra and after just two years on the project
Denis became a&nbsp;lead frontend developer (React, Redux, and
recently GraphQL) in the company. There is nothing impossible to
Denis.</p>

Denis is an amazing web developer: he learns fast, does his work
very thoroughly, he is super responsive and attentive to details.
He is a very calm and modest person. I'm proud to call him my
friend.</p>

You can reach me via email. Ask me anything.&#8221;</p>
